# Austrelian house price prediction
Our client Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. And wants to gain profit by purchasing house below their acttual price and sell in higher price .

We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:

1.Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

2.How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## Conclusions
We have used Ridge regression model as our final model for regularization , which is both robust and generalized .
